There are two ways of downloading and installing this code:
* [https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360#using-git Using Git]
* [https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360#using-zip-or-tar Using Zip or Tar]


== Using Git ==
Run the following instructions as normal user:
<ol>
<li>
Assuming you have <tt>git</tt> already installed and a working OpenFOAM installation, run:
<pre>mkdir -p $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
git clone git://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360.git
cd localFoamToTecplot360</pre>
</li>

<li>Now check the list of branches that exist:
<pre>git branch -a</pre>
You should see something like this:
<pre>* master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/of17
  remotes/origin/of20
  remotes/origin/of21
</pre>
The ones that start with <tt>of</tt> indicate for which versions of OpenFOAM this repository is currently working.
</li>

<li>So for example, if you are using OpenFOAM 2.1.1, then ''checkout'' the respective branch:
<pre>git checkout of21</pre>
</li>

<li>Now you can launch the build process:
<pre>./Allwmake</pre>
It will do everything pretty much autonomous, although midway it asks for you to press the ''Enter'' keyboard key when the <tt>libtecio</tt> library is finished unpacking.
</li>

<li>It should end with a line similar to this one:
<pre>-llagrangian -lfiniteVolume -lgenericPatchFields -lmeshTools -L/home/user/OpenFOAM/user-2.1.0/platforms/linux64GccDPOpt/lib -ltecio -lOpenFOAM -ldl   -lm -o /home/user/OpenFOAM/user-2.1.0/platforms/linux64GccDPOpt/bin/foamToTecplot360</pre>
</li>

<li>If all went well, you can now learn how ot use this conversor by running the following command:
<pre>foamToTecplot360 -help</pre>
</li>
</ol>


== Using Zip or Tar ==
Run the following instructions as normal user:
<ol>
<li>
Assuming you have a working OpenFOAM installation, run:
<pre>mkdir -p $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR</pre>
</li>

<li>Now, depending on the version of OpenFOAM you've got, download the respective package you need.
<ul>
<li>For OpenFOAM 1.7.0, 1.7.1 and 1.7.x, run either one of the following group of lines:
<pre># If you want to download in zip format
wget "https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360/archive/of17.zip"
unzip of17

# If you want to download in tar format
wget "https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360/archive/of17.tar.gz"
tar -xf of17.tar.gz</pre>

Then to into the newly unpacked folder:
<pre>cd localFoamToTecplot360-of17</pre>
</li>

<li>For OpenFOAM 2.0.0, 2.0.1 and 2.0.x, run either one of the following group of lines:
<pre># If you want to download in zip format
wget "https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360/archive/of20.zip"
unzip of20

# If you want to download in tar format
wget "https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360/archive/of20.tar.gz"
tar -xf of20.tar.gz</pre>

Then to into the newly unpacked folder:
<pre>cd localFoamToTecplot360-of20</pre>
</li>

<li>For OpenFOAM 2.1.0, 2.1.1 and 2.1.x, run either one of the following group of lines:
<pre># If you want to download in zip format
wget "https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360/archive/of21.zip"
unzip of21

# If you want to download in tar format
wget "https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360/archive/of21.tar.gz"
tar -xf of21.tar.gz</pre>

Then to into the newly unpacked folder:
<pre>cd localFoamToTecplot360-of21</pre>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Now you can launch the build process:
<pre>./Allwmake</pre>
It will do everything pretty much autonomous, although midway it asks for you to press the ''Enter'' keyboard key when the <tt>libtecio</tt> library is finished unpacking.
